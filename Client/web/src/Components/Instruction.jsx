      <h2>Chest Exercise Instructions</h2>
      <p>Building a strong chest can be achieved with various exercises, including the bench press, dumbbell press, or push-ups. Here's how to perform a basic dumbbell chest press:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Lie flat on your back on a bench, ensuring your feet are firmly planted on the ground. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, with your arms extended upward and perpendicular to the floor.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Execution:</strong> Lower the dumbbells slowly and with control until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle. Your upper arms should be parallel to the ground, and your elbows should be at the level of your chest.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Push:</strong> Pause for a moment, then press the dumbbells back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms. Keep your wrists straight and maintain a slight bend in your elbows at the top of the movement.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Breathing:</strong> Remember to breathe steadily throughout the exercise. Exhale as you push the weights up and inhale as you lower them down.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Repetitions:</strong> Aim for 8-12 repetitions per set, adjusting the weight accordingly to maintain proper form and intensity. Start with a weight that allows you to complete the desired number of repetitions with good technique.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Form:</strong> Focus on proper form and alignment throughout the movement to avoid injury. Keep your back flat against the bench, engage your core muscles, and avoid arching your back excessively.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Variations:</strong> Once you've mastered the basic dumbbell chest press, you can explore variations such as incline or decline presses to target different areas of the chest.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p className="final-para">Always consult with a fitness professional or trainer if you're new to weightlifting or have any concerns about your technique or safety.</p>
